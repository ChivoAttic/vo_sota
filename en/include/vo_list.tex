a software tool developed in JAVA that allows to visualize astronomical data
available in VOTable, ASCII and FITS formats.

\item \textbf{VOMegaPlot}:
a software tool developed in JAVA that allows to visualize astronomical data
available in VOTable format. It looks just like VOPlot. There is a client-server
version.

\item \textbf{AstroStat}:
a software tool that allows astronomers to use both and sophisticated statical
routines on large datasets uploaded in VOTable or ASCII format.

\item \textbf{VOCat}:
a software tool that converts astronomical catalogs to MySQL databases. 

\item \textbf{VOPlatform}:
a software tool developed in JAVA that allows to place their frequently used VO
tools and datasets with others resourcers like documents, links, among other.

\item \textbf{VOConvert (ConVOT)}:
a software tool that converts ASCII to VOTable files, FITS to VOTable and
VOTable to ASCII.

\item \textbf{Android Cosmological Calculator}:
an Android aplication that allows to input the Hubble constant, $ \Omega_{m} $
(matter), $ \Omega_{\lambda} $ (vacuum) and the redshift($ z $), and returns the
current age of the Universe, the co-moving radial distance and volume and the
angular size distance at the specified redshift, and the luminosity distance.

\item \textbf{Android Name Resolver}:
an Android application that allows to input the name of celestial object and
returns information of this like RA/DEC values, redshift, proper motion,
parallax, among other.

\item \textbf{CSharpFITS Package}:
a C\# .NET port of Tom McGlynn's nom.tam.fits JAVA packages\footnote{The C\#
.NET port of Tom McGlynn's nom.tam.fits JAVA packages are availablre from
\url{http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/fits/java/v0.9/javadoc/}}.

\item \textbf{VOTable JAVA Streaming Writer}:
a software that converts data streams in non-VOTable format, like ASCII or FITS,
to the VOTable format.

\item \textbf{C++ parser for VOTable}:
a C++ library to access VOTable files. It has a non-streaming and streaming
version.

\item \textbf{Fits Manager}:
a web-based tool for viewing, creating, adding extensions and converting FITS
files.

\item \textbf{HCT Data Archive System}:
a web-based system that archives the observational data generated by the
Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT), a 2 [m] aperture optical-infrared telescope
manufactured by the EOS Technologies Inc. and remotely operated via dedicated
satellite link.
