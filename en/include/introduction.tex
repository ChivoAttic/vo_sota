\section{Introduction}
	The Virtual Observatory (VO) is a international initiative which allows
the access to astronomical files and data centers to astronomers and any person
through Internet. With the standardization of the information and methods is
possible study the astronomical data without the physical requirement of the
tools and location.\\

	In June 2002, was made the International Virtual Observatory Alliance
(IVOA) to ``facilitate the international coordination and collaboration
necessary for the development and deployment of the tools, systems and
organizational structures necessary to enable the international utilization of
astronomical archives as an integrated and interoperating virtual observatory''.
Actually, the IVOA is composed of 19\footnote{On the official website in
\textbf{What is the IVOA} ``the IVOA now comprises 17 VO projects'', but in
\textbf{Member Organizations} appears 19 members listed.} projects of America,
Asia, Europa and Oceania; its members meet two times each year in
Interoperability  Workshops to have discussions face-to-face and resolve
technical questions.\\

	An initiative led by Ph. D. Mauricio Solar alongisde students of
Federico Santa Mar\'{i}a Technical University intends to develop an
astro-informatics platform to manage and analyse intelligently large-scale data
based on the IVOA standards. Due the above, this document aims:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Publicize the distribution of the virtual observatories worldwide.
	\item List the tools developed by the virtual observatories and their
status from the information provided on their official websites on Internet.
	\item Get an idea about what additional tools could be developed to
guarantee fulfilling the main objective\footnote{\textit{``Desarrollo de una
plataforma astro-inform\'{a}tica para la administraci\'{o}n y an\'{a}lisis
inteligente de datos a gran escala''} according to the name of Fondef D11$
\vert $1060 project}.
\end{itemize}

For these purposes were reviewed the official websites of the IVOA and its
members, were read sections of documents about virtual observatories like
``Virtual Observatories, Data Mining, and Astroinformatics'' of Kirk Borne,
George Mason University, among others.\\
